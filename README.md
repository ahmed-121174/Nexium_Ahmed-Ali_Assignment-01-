Hey dear make a clone of the repo by using command 
git clone http://github/ahmed-121174/Nexium_Ahmed-Ali_Assignment-01-.git

then open the folder in vs code
and run command: npm install
for generating files of node_modules
This folder contains all dependencies listed in your package.json

and then run command: npm run build 
This is the build output folder for a Next.js project
Or for development preview: run command: npm run dev

after running you will be given a localhost url in terminal run it and there you go with the website.

I have deployed it on vercel, You can see it using link: https://nexium-ahmed-ali-assignment-01.vercel.app/

Thank You!
